# Chess Game Analysis and Prediction

In this project for the Advanced Data Mining course, I analyze a dataset of over 20,000 chess games to uncover patterns in gameplay, player behavior, and strategic choices. The study includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering, community detection using the Louvain method, and a move prediction model built using a voting ensemble of Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
